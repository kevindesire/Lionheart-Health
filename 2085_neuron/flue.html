                              <p> The best treatment is to find ways to forestall ailment. <br>
                                Few common illnesses are more unpleasant than the flu. <br> The aches and pains, chills, fever, and cough are bad enough; add in the other potential symptoms of flu, including runny nose, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, or sore throat, and you'll want the illness to be over as soon as possible.  <br> How long does the flu last?  And does treating flu help make it go away faster? <br> The answers depend on your particular health. <br> <hr>
                               UNDERSTANDING FLUE. <br> <br>
The flu—or influenza—is a highly contagious respiratory virus caused by one of three different virus types:  influenza A, B, or C. <br> The main way that illnesses like colds and the flu spread from person to person is through the droplets that sick people propel when they cough and sneeze. <br> You can also get the flu by exposure to saliva passed by routine contact, such as kissing or sharing eating utensils. <br> <br> <hr>

How long does the flu last? <br> <br>
For most healthy people, the flu is an uncomfortable but short-term illness that resolves itself as the immune system fights it off. <br> Symptoms usually appear from one to four days after exposure to the virus, and they last five to seven days. <br> For people who've had a flu shot, the symptoms may last a shorter amount of time, or be less severe. <br> For other people, the symptoms may last longer. Even when symptoms resolve, you may continue to feel fatigued. <br> <br> <hr>

Some people are at increased risk for complications from influenza. <br> <br> These people include: <br>

the very young. <br>
people 65 or older. <br>
people with chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, HIV, or diabetes <br>
pregnant women. <br>
people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher. <br>
People in those groups may have weakened immune systems, and are at increased risk for the complication of pneumonia, which can be deadly. <br> <hr>

Treating flu. <br> <br>
If you get the flu, you should get rest and drink plenty of fluids. <br> Take pain relievers to lower your fever and relieve the aches, such as: <br>

acetaminophen (Tylenol) <br>
ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) <br>
naproxen (Aleve) <br>
If you are at high risk of complications, and if it is early in the infection, <br> your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug for treating flu, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu, generic versions). <br> <br> <hr>
Prevention. <br> <br>
To better predict how long the flu will last, take steps to reduce your risk of contracting the virus and experiencing severe symptoms. <br> Consider the following steps, as suggested in the Harvard Special Report A Guide to Women's Health: Fifty and Forward. <br> <br> <hr>

Get an annual flu vaccine. <br> <br> 
Wash your hands with soap and water before eating or touching your face. <br>
Contact your doctor for promptly if you get flu symptoms. <br>
Quit smoking. Smokers are more likely to get the flu than nonsmokers. <br>
These steps won't guarantee that you'll escape the flu this year, but they may help prevent it. <br> And they may help reduce the amount of time the flu lasts if you do become infected with the virus. <br> <hr>
